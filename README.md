# RGB-Arduino-controller
Arduino based RGB LED project that is controlled with a C++/Qt front end.
I created this project using my front panel PC Qt skeleton.
This project will control a non-addressable RGB LED strip powered via an external power supply and an Arduino.
If you are interested in the actual wiring, please let me know by emailing me at admin@danieljon.es
